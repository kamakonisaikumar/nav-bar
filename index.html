                  <h3>Robin Bird</h3>
                  <p>
                    Robins are small to medium-sized songbirds known for their reddish-orange breasts (in some species), though the coloration can vary. They are found in various habitats, including forests, parks, and gardens, and are known for their distinctive songs and foraging habits. There are several species of robin, including the European robin, the American robin, and the Indian robin, each with its own unique characteristics.

                 <h3>Herring gulls</h3>
                 <p>
                    Herring gulls are large, noisy, and common gulls, easily recognizable by their light gray backs, white underparts, and black wingtips with white "mirrors". They have pink legs and a yellow bill with a red spot near the tip. Adult herring gulls have white heads, which can be streaked with brown in the winter.

                 <h3> Kingfishers</h3>
                 <p>
                    Kingfishers are small to medium-sized, brightly colored birds known for their vibrant plumage, long, pointed bills, and hunting prowess, particularly their ability to catch fish. Most species are found in the Old World and Australasia, with a preference for tropical and warm regions near water sources. They have short legs, stubby tails, and large heads. While many species are associated with rivers and lakes, some inhabit forests and even deserts.
